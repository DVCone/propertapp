Hi Thank you for comming!

This is my first Implementation UI Design in Flutter Framework about Property Market App. in simple, I just name it "Propertapp".

I know it's not the best implementation code yet, but I try to make it easy to understand and also I try to write a code as clean as possible so I can practice clean code ethics.

You can practice too in this project with your own and develope this project into newest framework version, feel free to use my code.

## System Requirement :
- Dart v.2.16
- Flutter v.2.10

## Dependency Requirement :
- intl v.0.17.0

## What I learn from this project :
1. I learn how to make custom library for main Theme assets like color, font, text type, ect. see on **`constants.dart`**.
2. at first, in **`option_button.dart`** they use `flatButton` that flutter was migrated to `textButton` in newest version, so I re-code and customize the style in `textButton`.
3. In old version of flutter, they can use `flexible` widget inside `stack` widget, but not in newest one so I remove the widget and make adjust in assets routing at **`pubspec.yaml`**. you can see on `RealEstateItem stateless` in **`landing_page.dart`**.
4. I learn about `intl dependency` to make auto convert a number (int) into the currency. you can see on **`custom_functions.dart`**.
5. I learn how to make dummy JSON data, see on **`sample_data.dart`**.

If you want re-create and re-wrote this project, I hope you can find more what I can learn.
